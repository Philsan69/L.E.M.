A simple Lunar Lander's genre game for Atari VCS 2600 console (1977) programmed with Visual batariBasic.

I programmed simple Lunar Lander's genre games for other computers (Atari 8-bit and Commodore 64) therefore I think this game is a sort of "Hello Word" for me.

I want to thank Fred Quimby for awesome batariBasic and Harmony cart, Jeff Wierer for Visual batariBasic, Duane Alan Hahn for batariBasic manual, music and high score code, Mike Saarna for Titlescreen kernel, title screen's lander and score custom fonts all-in-one file, Steve Engelhardt for his code snippets and Stephen Anthony, Bradford Mott, Eckard Stolberg, Brian Watson (Stella multi-platform Atari 2600 VCS emulator).

Game's size is 4KB but I switched to 8KB when I added title screen's music and to 16KB when I added a bitmap title screen.

Special thanks to Brian Ostrowski for box, label, manual and patch design, Scott Lawrenz for manual (English language) and to Walter Lauer for patches production.

The game is reviewed in Brian Bagnall's "The Atari 2600 Homebrew Companion: Volume 1".

The game is free to download but a collectors edition is available on AtariAge store.
